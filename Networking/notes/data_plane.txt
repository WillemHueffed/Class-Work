# Data Plane - 5/16

## review
- Control plane: routing -> fowarding table (global)
- Data plane: fowarding - input -> output (local)

## Network Addresses
- Each network adapter card has its own IP addr
- Two ways to structure an IPv4 addr
  - Hierarchical/Geographic -> locations close together share more digits/prefix
  - Flat -> no relationship
- IP addr represented in "dotted-quad" notation

## Hierarchical IP Addresses
- IP = subnet ID (high-order bits, IP prefix) | host ID (low-order bits)
- 12.34.158.0/24 is a 24 bit prefix with 2^8 addresses
- Inter-domain routing operates on the network prefix
- Desintation network operates on the network component

## Subnets
- Subnet is identified by network id

## CIDR - Classless Inter-Domain Routing
- Introduces a hierarchical process for assignment of addresses
- Gives up simple notion of "network part" and "host part" of fixed sizes
- Past: use two 32 bit numbers to represent network:
  - Network number = IP addr + Mask
- ex: IP Addr: 12.4.0.0 - IP Mask: 255.254.0.0

## NAT - network address translation
- All datatrams leaving local network have the same single source NAT IP addr
- Port number is bottleneck

## IP Fragmentation
- network links have MTU (max transfer size) - largest possible link-level frame
- large ip datagram divided within networks
  - one datagram becomes several datagrams
  - reassmbed only at final destination

## Routers
- terms:
  - N = number of external ports
  - R = speed ("line rate") of a port
  - Router capacity = N * R
