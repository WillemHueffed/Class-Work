To run the server use the ./run.sh executable. You may have to run cargo init or something to download the requisite dependencies. This is my first real rust project so I'm not
super sure. running `cargo build` and then `cargo run` should also do the trick

To test:
I have static html pages working for all endpoints except patching review. However there is a shell script `patch_review.sh` that works as intended. You will have to modify the
hardcoded values though.

Note: This endpoint is dependent on hw1 to be functional. I'll try and remember to resubmit that project with this one. If not please use the version of hw1 I submitted in the 
original homework two.

Note2: To connect to your own DB just change the value of MONGOURI in the .env file
